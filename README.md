# ⚙ Numerical Programming Project ⚙

### Overview 🖼️
This project extracts curve-related data from hand-drawn images, interpolates them using 3 different methods, and plots the graphs. All core implementations, including edge detection, interpolation, and clustering, are custom-written.


### Project Structure 📂
- **Images/**: Contains 4 different curve images to work on.
- **Scripts/**:
  - `interpolations.py`: Implements interpolation algorithms using the Strategy Design Pattern. ⚙️
  - `edge_detection.py`: Custom Sobel edge detection. 🖌️
  - `clustering.py`: K-Means clustering and helper functions. 📊
  - `image_processing.py`: Image handling functions, including Sobel matrix application. 🖼️
  - `path_fixer.py`: Fixes path intersections. 🛠️
  - `main.py`: Runs the project. Switch interpolation algorithms and images easily. 🚀

### Features 🌟
- Custom edge detection for extracting unordered points from images.
- K-Means clustering for point reduction. 📉
- Path fixing for handling intersections using dot product direction checks. 🧩
- Curve segmentation and three interpolation methods:
  - Piecewise Linear Approximation 📏
  - Least Square Approximation 📊
  - Cubic Splines Approximation 🔗

### How to Run ⚙
1. Place your image in the `Images/` folder. 🖼️
2. Modify `main.py` to choose an interpolation method and image path. 🔧
3. Run `main.py` to process and plot the graph. 📈

### Notes 📝
- Interpolations are segmented for better visualization. 🎲
- Works on both closed and non-closed graphs. 🔄
